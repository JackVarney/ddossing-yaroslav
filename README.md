It was a Sunny morning at the QA offices.

Yaroslav sat in his chair, staring at me, stroking a cat.

"Aha, I recieved 350,000 requests to my site, but the page counter is only 7500", he cackled.
"YOU FOOL! Do you really think I wouldn't implement a timer to restrict you!"

I knew I had been thwarted. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't make his page counter a hilarious number.

I sat there, devastated, knowing I had let me peers down. I could see tears on Louis' face.

I spent that evening walking around, thinking about things.

How did I go so wrong? Where had i gotten so lost? Why was the evil villain able to so easily get one over on me?

I opened up the masterminds site. I searched for hours, for any opening, for some kind of way to win.

'Beer'.

Hmm, I wonder what this is.

'I am evil villian mastermind Yaroslav, if you would like to support my efforts to teach databases to students and wear patterned shirts, please use this paypal link'.

I felt mocked, maybe i should just join him. Maybe he was right, maybe page counters shouldnt be hilarious numbers?

Then I noticed it. Another page counter. Only this time - there was no timer.
